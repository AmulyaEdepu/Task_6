Consumer Complaint Text Classification
This project aims to classify consumer complaints from the Consumer Complaint Database into specific categories.

Categories
Credit reporting, repair, or other
Debt collection
Consumer Loan
Mortgage

Steps
1. Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and distributions.
Engineering relevant features that might aid in the classification process.

3. Text Pre-Processing
Cleaning and preparing the text data for modeling.
Techniques include tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.

4. Selection of Multi-Classification Model
Choosing appropriate algorithms for multi-class text classification.
Options might include Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks.

5. Comparison of Model Performance
Running multiple models and comparing their performance on a validation set.
Metrics to be considered: accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall for each class.

6. Model Evaluation
Final evaluation of the best-performing model on a test set.
Considering confusion matrix, ROC, and other relevant metrics for multi-class problems.

7. Prediction
Using the chosen model to classify new, unseen consumer complaints.
Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, NLTK/Spacy)
Jupyter Notebook or any relevant IDE
